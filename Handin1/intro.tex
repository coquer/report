\section{Introduction}

We were tasked with construction of a software eye tracker. In the following text we describe our approach to this challenge, the methods we used, and the results we have obtained.  We have built the eye tracker using Python and OpenCV as a toolkit. The purpose of the eye tracker is to correctly and accurately detect the eye (pupil, iris) and glints on the eye in every image where there is an eye and detect nothing if there is no eye present in the image.
